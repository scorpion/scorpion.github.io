## Overview

The goal of the scorpion project is to allow complete automation and control of your data. Our core foundations are built on an API first approach and breaking data out of proprietary systems, We can help provision frameworks properly that allow long term success any project.

By using the latest tools, techniques, and technologies, we can help bring best practices to developers that just want to make code. Build your next dream on solid open source foundations and let us help make it an easier transition. Transparency, documentation, traning, and supporting the community is why this project exists.
